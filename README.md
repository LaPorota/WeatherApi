# WeatherApi

Welcome to My weather API!

### How it works?

The **Weather Api** works with **Openweather**'s Rest API. It filters the information brought by the server to give you a good forecast avoiding the miscellany.

### How to use it?

**Weather Api** works with flask, so try to use it with your host up. You can use it without a runing server but I don't give guarantees that it will work :joy:

When your host is up you just can go to your favourite app (postman, imsomnia, web browser, etc) and do a **GET** request by adding url parameters on the **host/weather** path.

You'll have two functional parameters: **city** and **country**
